# Snake-Game

I remenber being a kid when the topseller "Nokia 3310" came to to world and had this famaous Snake Game. I used to beg my father's cellphone to play this game for as many time as I was allowed. To be good at this game you have to be concentrated and have fast reflects to eat as many apples as you can while not touching the borders or snake body parts. The game start being tricky when your snake become bigger and bigger after eating appels, the game board has less space and you need to perform tiny movements to score higher points. 


Hope you Enjoy!
